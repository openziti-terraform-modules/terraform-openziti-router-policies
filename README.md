# Terraform Module for Managing a Simple Set of OpenZiti Router Policies

Every OpenZiti Network needs at least one Edge Router Policy (ERP) and one Service Edge Router Policy (SERP). This module creates a simple set of policies to get started with OpenZiti. These have a default router role that you may assign to any publicly reachable routers. You must have at least one router that matches these policies.

Please feel free to raise an issue if you have a request.
